# JA MORANT NIKE YOUTUBE TEXT ANALYSIS - EMOTIONS IN COMMENTS

I wanted to create a text analysis using RStudio to evaluate the viewer's emotions and reactions (through comments) on Nike's recent advertisement of one their featured NBA athletes, Ja Morant.
Ja Morant is coming off a NBA suspension after gun possession on an online live video. The NBA suspended him for his actions. The Nike Youtube video highlights Morant's return to the court.
